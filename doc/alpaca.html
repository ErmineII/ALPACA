<h1>ALPACA</h1>

<h2>Language</h2>

<p><b>ALPACA</b> stands for <b>a</b> <b>l</b>anguage for <b>p</b>rogramming
<b>a</b>rbitrary <b>c</b>ellular <b>a</b>utomata.</p>

<h2>Cellular Automata</h2>

<p>While <a href="/projects/rube/">RUBE</a> was being developed it
became clear to the author that the "bully" approach to writing a
complex cellular automaton would result in a program
extremely difficult to understand
and even worse to maintain.</p>

<p>ALPACA was developed in order to have a terse, precise and readable
language in which to express the rules for any given cellular
automaton.  It is in ALPACA, then, that <a href="../eg/redgreen/">REDGREEN</a>,
a successor to RUBE,
is written.  Being described in ALPACA instead of C,
the source code for REDGREEN is easily a hundred times clearer than
the knotted mess that is RUBE.</p>

<p>Other cellular automata that have been successfully described in
ALPACA include John Conway's relatively famous <a href="../eg/life/">Game of Life</a> automaton
and the lesser-known <a href="../eg/wireworld/">WireWorld</a> automaton.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>You can download a copy of the ALPACA v0.90 distribution
from this web server.
It contains Perl 5 source code, documentation, example ALPACA descriptions,
and example automaton forms to use for them.</p>

<p>The compiler has now been hand-coded in Perl 5 (instead of C
automatically generated by CoCo/R, as was in v0.80) and produces a Perl program
that accepts an automaton form (a start state) as input, in the form of an ASCII text file, and
animates it.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>In brief, a description of a Cellular Automaton (CA) in
ALPACA consists of a number of state or class declarations,
seperated with semicolons and ending with a period.</p>

<p>A state declaration defines a state, associates a visual
element with it (currently an ASCII character, possibly someday a colour
or graphic) and is followed by a list of transition rules
seperated by commas.</p>

<p>A class declaration defines a class of states.  Each state
can belong to many classes, and are listed in overload order.
Classes can have their own rules, and the <code>is</code> operator can
be used to check for any of the states of a class instead of
a single state.</p>

<p>A transition rule specifies a state to change to and a
boolean expression to evaluate to see if that state should
be changed to.  The expression may make use of whether there
are a certain minimum number of neighbours of a state or class,
whether neighbours in certain positions hold a certain state
or class, and constant true, false, and random boolean terms,
manipulated by infix boolean operators.</p>

<p>For more detail see the <a href="ebnf.txt">EBNF</a>
description of the grammar, and examine the source for the REDGREEN
automaton in detail.</p>

<p>As an example, here is John Conway's <a href="../eg/life/">Game of Life</a> automaton,
expressed in ALPACA (it's short):</p>

<pre>state Dead  " "
  to Alive when 3 Alive and 5 Dead;
state Alive "*"
  to Dead when 4 Alive or 7 Dead.</pre>
